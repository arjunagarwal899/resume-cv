    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Scaled stroke-triage and lung-cancer products from R\&D to FDA-cleared deployments in 10+ countries
              \begin{enumerate}
                  \item Led the \textbf{Stroke \& Trauma Intelligence (qER)} program from \textbf{novice hire to R\&D lead}, spanning triage models (\textbf{AUC 0.85--0.98, DSC 0.30--0.95, $\downarrow$ 36\% MAE}) to published treatment recommendation systems, built on \textbf{140k} weakly annotated datapoints and \textbf{10k} radiologist-labeled scans, increasing patient referrals to specialized treatment centers by \textbf{\textasciitilde30\%} (estimated).
                  \item Transplanted the toolkit to the \textbf{Lung Cancer AI platform (qCT)}: raised AUCs (\textbf{specificity $\uparrow$ 0.1-0.2 @ same sensitivity}) on \textbf{22k} pulmonary nodules, built a ranking engine (\textbf{NDCG@5 0.92}), prototyped DETR with custom 3D mAP/mAR metrics. Currently supervising three scientists and three data engineers while leading research into multimodal malignancy scoring (CT, PET, biopsy, reports, EHR).
              \end{enumerate}
        \item Built future-facing research assets: a \textbf{CT-native foundation encoder} (SwinV2-3D/MaxViT + SimMIM + MedCLIP) with memory-aware training that boosts downstream qER models (\textbf{AUC +0.02, DSC +0.07}); physics-grounded synthesis that expanded scarce cohorts by \textbf{80\%}; a hierarchical NVAE (\textbf{SSIM 0.96/PSNR 36}) feeding latent diffusion studies; and the \textbf{`vision\_architectures`} library that standardizes 3D backbones with activation-checkpointing toggles, tensor-splitting parallelism, EMA students, diffusion schedulers, etc., adopted by CT R\&D.
        \item Collaborated with the regulatory and clinical research teams: led the fastest \textbf{FDA 510(k)} (\textbf{3.5 months}), fronted CE/MDR/MDSAP filings, co-authored papers/conference proceedings across qER and qCT pathways, and hold U.S./India patents on CTA automation.
        \item Ran \textbf{data, tooling, and production} infrastructure: governed 30+ TB multimodal datasets with Postgres/Mongo lineage, safetensor caching (\textbf{$\downarrow$ 80\%} access latency), NLP/LLM report parsing and annotation automation, that drove a \textbf{3x} normalized annotation-throughput gain; architected a custom process-graph pipeline with TorchScript and nested Pydantic configs, \textgreater{}2k pytest cases (coverage \textbf{22\%\textrightarrow{}91\%}), cut turnaround \textbf{57\%}, slashed integration from \textbf{8} to \textbf{1} day, and eliminated config-driven incidents across on-prem/cloud/hybrid deployments.
