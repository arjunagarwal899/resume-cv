        \cvPoint{}{Experimenting with large-scale \textbf{self-supervised pretraining} methods such as \emph{SimMIM (masked image modeling)} and \emph{MedCLIP} (\emph{contrastive learning} tailored towards medical images) to create a \textbf{foundation model for three-dimensional spatial radiological imaging}.}
        \cvPoint{}{Exploring multiple architectures like \emph{SwinV2}, \emph{MaxViT}, \emph{ViTDet}, \emph{ConvNext}, \emph{EfficientNet}, \emph{SeResNet}, etc., coupled with a \emph{BERT}-based text encoder,  to create the best image encoder possible.}
        \cvPoint{}{Developed multiple models with over 300 experiments performed to detect stroke in Head CT and MRI scans:}
        \cvNestedPoint{}{Developed a \textbf{semantic segmentation} model using a \emph{U-Net} architecture for identifying strokes on Head MRI scans, achieving a \textbf{Dice coefficient of 0.7}.}
        \cvNestedPoint{}{Developed a proprietary \textbf{classification + detection} algorithm by stacking and combining four \emph{ResNet}-based models and image registration to identify occlusions in the large vessels of the brain on Head CTA scans, achieving an \textbf{average AUC of 0.98}.}
        \cvNestedPoint{}{Developed multiple \textbf{multi-class classification + segmentation} models using CNN-based, transformer-based, and hybrid encoders to solve for various problems on Head NCCT scans, achieving \textbf{AUCs of 0.90-0.96 and Dice coefficients of 0.25-0.7}.}
        \cvPoint{}{Utilized image registration, tilt correction, symmetry attention, synthetic data generation, and other novel approaches to solve for challenges relating to data quality and quantity, noisy labels, and limited infrastructure.}
        \cvPoint{}{Streamlined model deployment by optimizing preprocessing steps, implementing tracing, and modularizing the code, resulting in a \textbf{57\% reduction in turnaround time} of production models and \textbf{making it future-proof}.}
        \cvPoint{}{\textbf{In-charge of production code} relating to AI processing and output generation for our emergency response product (qER).}
        \cvPoint{}{\textbf{Co-authored multiple papers and abstracts} in various computer vision and medical journals and conferences (some listed below). \textbf{Co-invented patents too}.}
